Hauler View: What Riders/Members See
Homepage Look
Top Bar:
Left: Profile icon (e.g., “Jake | Speed Demon Badge”).
Right: Wallet (e.g., “12.5 USDC | 0.1 MATIC”).
Badge mini-gallery (scrollable: “Quick Hauler,” “Eco Warrior”).
Main Section:
Map View (default, 70% of screen):
Google Maps-style interface showing pins for nearby hauls.
Pins labeled with basics (e.g., “$5 | 3 mi | 5 lbs”).

$5 | 3.2 mi | 5 lbs  
Laptop | Pickup: 123 Main St | Drop-off: 456 Oak Ave  
[Take Job]
Bottom Bar:
Button: “Refresh Jobs” (updates map/list).
Filter: “Distance | Payout | Vehicle Fit | Eco Only.”
How It Works
Browsing:
Hauler opens app, sees map with pins (e.g., 5 hauls within 5 miles).
Taps a pin (e.g., “$7 | 7 mi | 15 lbs | Toolbox”) for details: pickup/drop-off, deadline (e.g., “By 5 PM”).
Claiming:
Hits “Take Job”—smart contract locks it (0.001 MATIC gas).
Job moves to “My Hauls” tab; map shifts to navigation mode (pickup pin + route).
Execution:
Hauler picks up item, scans QR code from poster (or uses geolocation).
Delivers, scans again—5 USDC releases from escrow to wallet.

Weight (e.g., “5 lbs”).
Pickup (auto-fills current location or manual entry).

Deadline (e.g., “1 hour” = rush, +50%).

How It Works
Posting:

Haul appears on hauler maps instantly.
Tracking:
Once Mike claims it, Sara’s homepage shifts to a map with Mike’s dot moving.

App Look & Feel
Design:
Colors: Green (eco/base), yellow (mid-tier), red (rush)—bold but clean. Dark mode option.
Font: Sans-serif (e.g., Roboto)—crisp, readable.
Icons: Minimalist (e.g., bike for hauler, box for haul, star for badges).
Flow:
Hauler: Open → Browse → Claim → Haul → Earn.
Poster: Open → Post → Track → Confirm → Done.
Feedback:
Push notifications: “New $7 haul nearby!” or “Your haul’s on the move.”
Haptic buzz on job claim or delivery.
Functionality Details
Hauler Experience:
See Hauls: Map pins update every 10 seconds (Polygon’s speed helps). List view sorts by “Nearest” or “Highest Pay.”
Take It: “Take Job” locks it for 5 mins—hauler must reach pickup, or it reopens.
Location: Hauler’s GPS pings (opt-in) for poster to track; turns off post-delivery.
Poster Experience:
Post It: Form auto-calcs price (e.g., 7 miles + 15 lbs = $7). Payment selector defaults to last used (e.g., PayPal).
See Hauler: Once claimed, map zooms to hauler’s dot + ETA (AI-driven).
Completion: QR scan or geolocation confirms—auto if poster’s AFK.
Shared Features:
Wallet: Shows USDC earnings/spent, MATIC for gas, and badge progress (e.g., “3/5 hauls to Load Lord”).
Toggle: Switch between Hauler/Poster modes via a swipe or button.
Why It’s Slick
Haulers: Map-first design makes grabbing jobs fast—see a $5 pin, tap, go. Badges up top flex their hustle.
Posters: Simple form + live tracking kills anxiety—know exactly where your stuff is.
Polygon Power: Cheap, quick USDC txs (e.g., 5 USDC escrow = $0.001 gas) keep it seamless.
Does This Click?
Picture this: Hauler Mike opens HaulHub, spots a $5 laptop haul 2 miles away, claims it, and rides off. Poster Sara posts it, pays with PayPal, and watches Mike’s dot zoom over—all from a sleek homepage. Catch your eye now? Want to tweak the layout (e.g., bigger map, more filters)

App-Wide Look & Feel
Design:
Colors: Green (base favors), yellow (mid-tier), red (rush)—softened with beige/orange for warmth.
Font: Casual sans-serif (e.g., Open Sans)—readable, approachable.
Icons: Hands, bikes, boxes—not trucks or corporate logos.
Tone:
“Help out, earn tips!” (hauler) / “Need a hand? Tip $5!” (poster).
No “delivery” or “courier”—all “favor,” “help,” “tip.”
Tech Fit:
Runs on Hostinger VPS (5 GB RAM)—map pulls from Google Maps API, tracker pings via geolocation, all lightweight.
Polygon USDC escrow stays fast/cheap (~$0.001 gas).
Why This Fits Favor Framing
Hauler: Map screams “help nearby folks”—pins feel like requests, not gigs. “Help Out” button = casual commitment, badges add fun.
Poster: Form says “ask a favor”—not “book a service.” Tracker’s personal (“Mike’s helping”) vs. impersonal (“Driver en route”).
Legal: “Tips” and “favors” dodge courier vibes—Polygon’s backend still secures it, but the front feels informal.
